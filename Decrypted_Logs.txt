erial to work with  and I can even cut it. Remember when I was cutting Hab canvas into strips? Those same shears are right here in my tool kit.

Cutting a chunk out of my EVA suit leaves it with another hole. But a hole I can control the shape and location of.

Yeah    I think I see a solution here. I m going to cut off my arm!

Well  no. Not my arm. The EVA suit s arm. I ll cut right below the left elbow. Then I can cut along its length  turning it into a rectangle. It ll be big enough to seal the faceplate  and it ll be held in place by the resin.

Material designed to withstand atmospheric pressure? Check.

Resin designed to seal a breach against that pressure? Check.

And what about the gaping hole on the stumpy arm? Unlike my faceplate  the suit s material is flexible. I ll press it together and seal it with resin. I ll have to press my left arm against my side while I m in the suit  but there ll be room.

I ll be spreading the resin pretty thin  but it s literally the strongest adhesive known to man. And it doesn t have to be a perfect seal. It just has to last long enough for me to get to safety.

And where will that  safety  be? Not a damn clue.

Anyway  one problem at a time. Right now I m fixing the EVA suit.

Cutting the arm off the suit was easy; so was cutting along its length to make a rectangle. Those shears are strong as hell.

Cleaning the glass off the faceplate took longer than I d expected. It s unlikely it would puncture EVA suit material  but I m not taking any chances. Besides  I don t want glass in my face when I m wearing it.

Then came the tricky part. Once I broke the seal on the patch kit  I had sixty seconds before the resin set. I scooped it off the patch kit with my fingers and quickly spread it around the rim of the faceplate. Then I took what was left and sealed the arm hole.

I pressed the rectangle of suit material onto the helmet with both hands while using my knee to keep pressure on the arm s seam.

I held on until I d counted 120 seconds. Just to be sure.

It seemed to work well. The seal looked strong and the resin was rock-hard. I did  however  glue my hand to the helmet.

Stop laughing.

In retrospect  using my fingers to spread the resin wasn t the best plan. Fortunately  my left hand was still free. After some grunting and a lot of profanities  I was able to reach the toolbox. Once I got a screwdriver  I chiseled myself free (feeling really stupid the whole time). It was a delicate process because I didn t want to flay the skin off my fingers. I had to get the screwdriver between the helmet and the resin. I freed my hand and didn t draw blood  so I call that a win. Though I ll have hardened resin on my fingers for days  just like a kid who played with Krazy Glue.

Using the arm computer  I had the suit overpressurize to 1.2 atmospheres. The faceplate patch bowed outward but otherwise held firm. The arm filled in  threatening to tear the new seam  but stayed in one piece.

Then I watched the readouts to see how airtight things were.

Answer   Not very.

It absolutely pissed the air out. In sixty seconds it leaked so much it pressurized the whole airlock to 1.2 atmospheres.

The suit is designed for eight hours of use. That works out to 250 milliliters of liquid oxygen. Just to be safe  the suit has a full liter of O2 capacity. But that s only half the story. The rest of the air is nitrogen. It s just there to add pressure. When the suit leaks  that s what it backfills with. The suit has two liters of liquid N2 storage.

Let s call the volume of the airlock two cubic meters. The inflated EVA suit probably takes up half of it. So it took five minutes to add 0.2 atmospheres to 1 cubic meter. That s 285 grams of air (trust me on the math). The air in the tanks is around 1 gram per cubic centimeter  meaning I just lost 285 milliliters.

The three tanks combined had 3000 milliliters to start with. A lot of that was used to maintain pressure while the airlock was leaking. Also  my breathing turned some oxygen into carbon dioxide  which was captured by the suit s CO2 filters.

Checking the readouts  I see that I have 410 milliliters of oxygen  738 milliliters of nitrogen. Together  they make almost 1150 milliliters to work with. That  divided by 285 milliliters lost per minute    

Once I m out of the airlock  this EVA suit will only last four minutes.

(BEEP).
